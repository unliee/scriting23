       <h1>PERSONALITY AND HABITS</h1>
        <p>Captain Jacksparrow even though a pirate of the 18th century stands out significantly when compared to other
            pirates of his time. These few qualities are some of the obvious traits of Captain Jacksparrow:<br></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Captain Jacksparrow like other pirates is fascinated by the adventure that comes with sailing the
                    oceans but he perceives the whole thing differently; he appreciates the freedom that having a ship
                    can give you in the 1700s. <br>
                    This is the reason why Jack will prefer to go in search of lost treasures rather than robbing and
                    pillaging others like tradintionaly pirate of the time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Captain Jack is the physical personification of self-interest prioritized.</li>
            <li>He is extremely witty, charismatic and most times, morally gray</li>
            <li>A stickler of the Pirate Codes; when he wants to.</li>
            <li>A Drunkard.</li>
            <li> Never barbaric or violent, naturally will try to escape an unsafe situation and will only resort to
                fighting when it is absolutely necessary.</li>
        </ul>

            is designated to throw others off</p>
        <p>Another great skill that The Captain has is his negotiating skills, Jack can and will negotiate himself out
            of any given situation, be it escaping an execution to convincing his crew members to take the craziest
