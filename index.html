                    <p>Ifeanyi Kenneth Nzubechi is an international student currently enrolled to the Multimedia
                        production at Lethbridge College. He has tried his hand on all media related crafts and he is
                        convinced that media art is his life.
                        An artist at heart, his devout love and respect for arts has stopped him from officially kicking
                        off his career as a film/music writer, producer and director until he has properly acquired the
                        professional skills to enable him to properly convey and communicate his creativity. <br>

                        Kenneth was born and raised in Nigeria, a country with heavy presence of storytelling and a
                        robust history in general. Due to his vivid imagination, He was influenced greatly by movies and
                        also physical events that happened around him growing up. After secondary school, Kenneth
                        apprenticed in a bookshop in the capital city of Nigeria; Abuja, where he was a bookkeeper and
                        salesman from 2014 to 2019. He considers period to be one of the greatest blessings of his life
                        because most times driven by love and passion, and some other times out of sheer boredom. <br>

                        He travelled to the Philippines where he tried to pursue an academic goal of acquiring a
                        bachelorâ€™s degree in psychology. Eventually he remembers that true happiness can only be found
                        when passion is monetized. </p>

                <p>I was very influnced by the book half of a yellow sun. When I was younger, reading big volumn books seemed like the most impossible thing until I started reading this book, I suddenly developed the passion for reading because this book is very engaging, at some point, I found myself wishing the book will not come to an end. I am grateful for the experience</p>
