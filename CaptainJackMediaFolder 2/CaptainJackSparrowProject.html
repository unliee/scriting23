        <h1>PERSONALITY AND HABITS</h1>
        <p>Captain Jacksparrow even though a pirate of the 18th century stands out significantly when compared to other
            pirates of his time. These few qualities are some of the obvious traits of Captain Jacksparrow:<br></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Captain Jacksparrow like other pirates is fascinated by the adventure that comes with sailing the
                    oceans but he perceives the whole thing differently; he appreciates the freedom that having a ship
                    can give you in the 1700s. <br>
                    This is the reason why Jack will prefer to go in search of lost treasures rather than robbing and
                    pillaging others like tradintionaly pirate of the time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Captain Jack is the physical personification of self-interest prioritized.</li>
            <li>He is extremely witty, charismatic and most times, morally gray</li>
            <li>A stickler of the Pirate Codes; when he wants to.</li>
            <li>A Drunkard.</li>
            <li> Never barbaric or violent, naturally will try to escape an unsafe situation and will only resort to
                fighting when it is absolutely necessary.</li>
        </ul>
